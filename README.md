# SVG Logo Maker

  

  ## Description

  The goal of this project was to create an application that would respond to user input using the Inquirer package and generate logos in the form of .svg files based on the user's responses. Users would have the option to choose three letters for their logo, as well as a shape (circle, triangle, or square).
